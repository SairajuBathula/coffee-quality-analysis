# Coffee Quality Analysis â€” Power BI Project

> **Status:** Production-ready â€¢ **Last updated:** 2025-08-22

This repository/documentation explains a Power BI report that analyzes coffee quality using **sensory attributes**, **processing methods**, **origin countries**, and **defect counts** to understand their impact on **Total Cup Points**. It is written to be copyâ€‘paste ready for a `README.md` on GitHub.

## ðŸ“Œ Business Goal

Provide a decision-support dashboard for coffee buyers and Q-graders to:
- Identify the **drivers of Total Cup Points** (aroma, flavor, acidity, body, etc.).
- See how **processing methods** and **country of origin** influence quality.
- Track the **relationship between defects and cup score**.
- Compare **grades** (Basic, Standard, Premium) across all dimensions.

---

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack & Power BI Features

- **Power BI Desktop** (recent version).
- Data preparation with **Power Query (M)**: data types, trimming/cleaning, null handling.
- **Modeling** with a simple **star schema** (fact table with measures + supporting dimensions).
- **DAX** measures for KPIs and visual aggregations.
- **Visuals**: Card, Matrix, Clustered Bar/Column, Line/Area, Scatter with **Analytics trendline**, **Map (Bing)** / Filled Map, Slicers.
- **Interactions**: cross-filtering, **Sync Slicers** for Grade across pages.
- **Formatting**: custom theme, data labels, titles, tooltips.
- **Performance**: hide unused columns, summarize by measures, avoid row-by-row calculated columns when possible.

> RLS/Whatâ€‘If parameters/Bookmarks are **not required** for this solution; you can add them later if you need segmented access or scenario planning.
